# Overview

Phones have always had a big impact on how people process the world. By understanding the brands with the highest popularity, we can understand their influence as well. By understanding popularity, we are capable of understanding what brand is more highly valued in society. The code made in this program is displayed in r in order to first understand values found in phone sales, then to change the layout of those values, and to finally visualize this altogether as a final overview of phone sales and popularity.

# Development Environment

One of the greatest tools I used was the csv file I found throught the website, dataworld. It is a compilation of all the data that I needed in order to compile a visualization of phone sales and popularity.

I used the r programming language that is specifically made in order to visualize data. The libraries I used were tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, readr, and stringi. Not all imported libraries were exactly used, but I alwyas have them there just in case if I need them.

# Future Work

- Item 1: I need to configure so that the text in the code is somehow separated better, so it doesn't mix together to make nonsense.
- Item 2: I need to configure the text too show up bigger in order to be easier to read.
- Item 3: I need to add a data table that shows average numbers instead of just a chart.
